/*---------------------------  5.6 ointer Arrays ; Pointer to Pointers -----------------------------------------*/

/*

- Array of pointers : Eg. Data representation that will cope efficiently and conveniently with variable-length text lines.
- Eg. Sorting functions. When two out of order lines are exchanged, we exchange their points, NOT the lines themselves.
        - Eliminates High Overhead
        - Eliminates Complicated Storage Management
