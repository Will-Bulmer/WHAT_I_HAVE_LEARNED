/*---------------------------  7.6 Error Handling - Stderr and Exit -----------------------------------------*/

/*

Treatment of erros in CAT is not ideal. Diagnostic is printed at the end of the concatenated output. 
    This is not great if the output is going to another file or program via the pipeline.

Omitted.
