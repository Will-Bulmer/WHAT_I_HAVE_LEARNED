/*---------------------------  2.6 - Relational and Logical Operators  -----------------------------------------*/

/*

 -------     RELATIONAL     --------
 ==, !=       <<<      >, >=, <, <=

 Relational Operators have much lower precedence than arithmetic operators.

 i < lim-1     --->      i < (lim - 1)



 -------    LOGICAL      -------
 Logical operators have much lower precedence than relational operators.
 s
 || and  && are evaluated from LEFT to RIGHT
 ||       <<<      && 


- Unary negation operaetor ! converts a non-zero operand into 0, and a zero operand into 1

if (!valid)    rather than      if(valid == 0)
