## Clean Code Essentials

- Employ unit and acceptance tests.
- Implement Test-Driven Development.
- Strive for minimalistic code.

## Ron Jeffries' Key Points

- Simple code: passes tests, no duplication, expresses design ideas, minimizes entities.
- **Eclipse** simplifies renaming.
- Single responsibility: each method or object should do one task. Use **Extract Method** for refactoring. Extract another function from an existing one.
- Encapsulate collections in an abstract method or class.
- Clean code hallmarks: "Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, early building of simple abstractions."
- Post-reading "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices" (PPP), study design principles: SRP, OCP, DIP.
