## Software Development Life-Cycle

1. Planning
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Designing
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment

This is old. Want to test early.

**Iterative Design Cycle**:
Dream up what you THINK you need, write a test, make it pass, take a step back and decide if that is actually what you need.
This way, you develop your requirements as part of a iterative design cycle.
